# This is a Discord bot made for the Hearts are Blazing discord fighting game community to provide utility for members.

The aplication uses the JDA5 discord wrapper API and is running 24/7 linked to a discord bot account within the server.
Its main role as of right now is providing the ability to pin or unpin important messages for members within threads they own, be it Tournament Organizers in the upcoming events forum or just newcomers looking for help in the advice forum.
As a fully functioning skeleton of a framework though, there is possibility to grow greatly to accomodate any features necessary in the future.
